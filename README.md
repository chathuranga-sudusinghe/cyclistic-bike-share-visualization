## 🔍 Key Business Insights

1. Ride demand shows **strong seasonality**, with peaks during mid-year (summer months).
2. **Peak usage occurs during commuting hours**, indicating work-related travel behavior.
3. A small group of stations accounts for a large portion of total demand.
4. **Electric bikes are the most preferred rideable type**.
5. Members represent the majority of rides, while casual users still form a large segment.
6. Casual riders take **longer trips on average**, indicating leisure usage.
7. Weekday rides exceed weekend rides, supporting a commuting-dominant usage pattern.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. Increase the availability of **electric bikes** at high-demand stations.
2. Focus operational rebalancing on **top start & end stations**.
3. Convert frequent casual riders into members using **targeted promotions**.
4. Schedule bike maintenance during **low-demand late-night hours**.
5. Increase **marketing spend during spring and summer** to maximize growth.
